## Overview

 Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.

 Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.

 Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.

 Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

### The challenge

Build out this results summary component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
We provide the data for the results in a local `data.json` file. So you can use that to add the results and total score dynamically if you choose.
Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page


## Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
